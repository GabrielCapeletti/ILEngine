# ILEngine
This project is built to study the process of developing a game engine.

I felt inspired to do this project after seeing a friend of mine developing his own [engine](https://github.com/marciovmf/ldk) completely from scratch. 

Differently from Marcio I do not pretend to implement everything from scratch, what I aim is to develop its core and try different ways to handle data in a game environment. For now I will not use any book or guide to develop it (except from Marcio's engine), but this will change along the development.
